![Elm Tooling](https://github.com/Xandrak/pupperoni/actions/workflows/elm-tooling.yml/badge.svg)

Small, example Elm application utilizing a dog breed API.


## Future Enhancements
1. Accessibility - style the app utilizing WCAG 
2. Add ID's to appropriate elements -- can make testing easier with Browserstack/LogRocket/etc and also helps with Accessibility
3. STYLING -- needs pizzazz
4. Better error handling and communication to user.
5. Display the breed selected to user on images page.
6. Maybe refactor using query params for pagination.
7. Better UI - Scroll back to top when clicking Next/Previous buttons.
